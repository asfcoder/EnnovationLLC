          <h1>HOW WE MET</h1>
          <p>
            Back in 2010, we met in a band called 'No Clue.' We were just musicians trying to make the most of life and truly enjoy, but we found something even more special - an amazing friendship. Laughing, playing music, and spending lots of time together made us best friends. 
            <br>
            We didn’t realize it at first, but our friendship slowly turned into something magical.
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>  
            It took a couple of years before we admitted our feelings. Then, on September 25th (which also happens to be her birthday), we knew it was something real and lucky for both of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, we went on adventures, explored new places, and shared lots of laughter, most of them with our darling nugget by our side. Our friendship grew deeper, and after more than a decade together, we’re excited to take the next big step and get married.
